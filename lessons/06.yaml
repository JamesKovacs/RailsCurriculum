  * In your terminal, try:
  
  <pre>
  git status
  git add .
  git commit -m "Added all the things"
  git status
  </pre>

  The previous step didn't do anything with our application. It is time
  to add them to the repo now.

goal_title: Add the project to the git repo
explanation: |
  
  * "git status" tells you everything git sees as modified, new, or missing.
  ** The first time you run this, you should see a ton of stuff.
  ** The second time you run this, you shouldn't see much of anything.
  * "git add" tells git that you want to add the current directory and everything under it to the repo.
  * "git commit" tells git to actually _do_ all things you've said you wanted to do.
  ** This is done in two steps so you can group multiple changes together.
  ** '-m "Added all the things"' is just a shortcut to say what your commit message is. You can skip that part and git will bring up an editor to fill out a more detailed message.
