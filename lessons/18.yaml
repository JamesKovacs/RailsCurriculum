steps: |
  
  * Let's start by removing the description
  * Open app/views/topics/index.html.erb
  
  * Delete the line that looks like this:
  
  <pre>
  <td><%= topic.description %></td>
  </pre>
  
  * Also delete the line that looks like this:
  
  <pre>
  <th>Description</th>
  </pre>
  
  * If you save and try to load it in the browser you should see that the description no longer appears
  * Now to make the title a link
  * In app/views/topics/index.html.erb again replace this line:
  
  <pre>
  <td><%= topic.title %></td>
  </pre>
  
  with this
  
  <pre>
  <td><%= link_to topic.title, topic %></td>
  </pre>
