goal_title: Make the topic title a link
goal: |
  
  Your friends recommended two changes for the site:
  
  * Don't show the description on the list page
  * Make the title a link and when its clicked show the description

steps: |
  
  * Let's start by removing the description
  * Open `app/views/topics/index.html.erb`
  * Delete the line that looks like this:
  
  <pre class="code">
  &lt;td>&lt;%= topic.description %>&lt;/td>
  </pre>
  
  * Also delete the line that looks like this:
  
  <pre class="code">
  &lt;th>Description&lt;/th>
  </pre>
  
  * If you save and try to load it in the browser you should see that the description no longer appears
  * Now to make the title a link
  * In `app/views/topics/index.html.erb` again replace this line:
  
  <pre class="code">
  &lt;td>&lt;%= topic.title %>&lt;/td>
  </pre>
  
  with this
  
  <pre class="code">
  &lt;td>&lt;%= link_to topic.title, topic %>&lt;/td>
  </pre>
