goal: |

  
  Let's get started! By the end of this step, we'll have a
  brand-spankin'-new (empty) rails app.

steps: |
  
  Open up a terminal window and try out the following.
  
      mkdir railsbridge
      cd railsbridge
      rails new suggestotron
      cd suggestotron
      ls
  
  If you have _any_ problems, contact a TA immediately.

explanation: |

  * 'mkdir' stands for make directory (folder).
    * We've made a folder called railsbridge
  * 'cd' stands for change directory.
    * 'cd railsbridge' makes railsbridge our current directory.
  * 'rails new' creates a new rails project with the name you give.
    * In this case we told it to create a new project called suggestotron.
    * We'll go into detail on what it created shortly.
  * 'ls' stands for "list (stuff)".
    * It shows you the contents of the current folder.

  You can see that <code>rails new</code> created a lot directors and
  files. The ones we want to focus on today are:

  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" align="center">
    <tr>
    <th> File/Folder
    </th><th> Purpose
    </th></tr>
    <tr>
    <td> app/
    </td><td> Contains the controllers, models, and views for your application.  You will do most of your work here.
    </td></tr>
    <tr>
    <td> config/
    </td><td> Configure your applicationâ€™s runtime rules, routes, database, and more.
    </td></tr>
    <tr>
    <td> db/
    </td><td> Shows your current database schema, as well as the database migrations.
    </td></tr>
    <tr>
    <td> public/
    </td><td> The only folder seen to the world as-is.  This is where your images, JavaScript,  stylesheets (CSS), and other static files go
    </td></tr>
  </table>

  There is a lot more that `rails new` created. Probably enough to fill
  a book, so we're going to ignore them for now.
