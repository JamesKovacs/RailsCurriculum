  Rails implements a very specific notion of the
  '''Model-View-Controller''' pattern, which guides how you build a web
  application.
  
  '''Model'''
  
  * represents what is in the database
  * ActiveRecord, ActiveModel
  * TODO: clarify
  
  '''View'''
  
  * the model rendered as HTML
  * ActionView, erb
  * TODO: clarify
  
  '''Controller'''
  
  * receives HTTP actions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  * decides what to do, such as rendering a view
  * ActionController
  * TODO: clarify
