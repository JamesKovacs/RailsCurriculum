  To teach you Ruby on Rails we are setting up a business case for an online voting system. We have requirements that our system should allow users to
  * register and login
  * view the topics sorted by number of votes
  * vote on topics
  * create, edit, and destroy topics
  Also, we have been told the UI should look like this from our business users:
  [[File:Example.jpg]]
  
  Of these requirements, our goal for today is to have a working app online that allows users to manage topics and vote on them. If time allows we can discuss the registration, login, and UI designing aspects of the project.
