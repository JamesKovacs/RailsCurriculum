  ### Goal

  To teach you Ruby on Rails we are setting up a business case for an online voting system. We have requirements that our system should allow users to

  * register and login
  * view the topics sorted by number of votes
  * vote on topics
  * create, edit, and destroy topics

  Also, we have been told the UI should look like this from our business users:
  [[File:Example.jpg]]
  
  Of these requirements, our goal for today is to have a working app online that allows users to manage topics and vote on them. If time allows we can discuss the registration, login, and UI designing aspects of the project.

  ### Meta-Goal

  When you have completed today's goal of getting the basic application online you should understand:

  * Basic Ruby syntax
  * How to test your Ruby code (irb)
  * How to go from requirements to a new working Rails application
  * How to get your application online
  * The basic tools a RoR developer uses (source control, editor, console, local server)

  ### Schedule

  * 1-ish hour of ruby
  * 4-ish hours of rails, broken up in 1-ish hour steps
  
  This is just a rough guideline, not a mandate. Some steps you'll go
  over and some you'll go under. It'll all work out by the end of the
  day... unless I really screwed something up. :D

  ### Format

  Each lesson will look like this:
  
  <div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 2em; padding: 1em;">
  <h2>Section Title</h2>
  <div class="top-goal">
  section desc
  <h3>Step Title</h3>
  <div class="goal">
  <h4>Goal:</h4>
  <p>Description of the current step.
  <p>Red because big goals are scary.
  </div> <!-- goal -->
  <div class="steps">
  <h4>Steps:</h4>
  <pre class="term">
  % steps to take.
  </pre>
  <pre class="code">
  def code_to_write
    1 + 1
  end
  </pre>
  <p>Yellow because we've gotten it done, but we have no clue what's going on.
  </div> <!-- steps -->
  <div class="what">
  <h4>What Just Happened?</h4>
  <p>details of what the steps actually did... spell out the cause and effect.
  <p>Green because we can tie everything together now.
  </div> <!-- what -->
  </div> <!-- top-goal -->
  </div>
