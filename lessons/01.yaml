  ### Goal

  To teach you Ruby on Rails we are going to use a "Real World"
  example. You've decided to create a voting system for you and your
  friends to play with. You've decided at a minimum, you'd like to
  allow users to:

  * view the topics sorted by number of votes
  * vote on topics
  * create, edit, and destroy topics

  You've sketched up an initial screenshot of what you want it to look like:

  ### Meta-Goal

  When you have completed today's goal of getting the basic
  application online you should understand:

  * Basic Ruby syntax
  * How to test your Ruby code (irb)
  * How to go from requirements to a new working Rails application
  * How to get your application online
  * The basic tools a RoR developer uses (source control, editor, console, local server)

  ### Schedule

  * 1-ish hour of ruby
  * 4-ish hours of rails, broken up in 1-ish hour steps
  
  This is just a rough guideline, not a mandate. Some steps you'll go
  over and some you'll go under. It'll all work out by the end of the
  day... unless I really screwed something up. :D

  ### Requirements

  We're going to be working with:

  * ruby 1.9.2 installed via rvm (mac or linux) or railsinstaller (windows)
  * rails 3.0.x (**note:** _not_ rails 3.1!)
  * bundler
  * sqlite
  * the text editor of your choice

  Everything should be set up the night before during our
  install-fest. Please ensure you have everything working _before_ you
  show up for railsbridge on Saturday.

  You can verify that you have everything working by trying this out in your terminal:

      % irb
      >> 1 + 2
      => 3
      >> require "active_support"
      => true
      >> exit
      %

  If you can do that, you are probably good to go.

  ### Format

  Each lesson will look like this:
  
  <div style="background: white; border: 1px solid black; margin: 2em; padding: 1em;">
  <h2>Section Title</h2>
  <div class="top-goal">
  section desc
  <h3>Step Title</h3>
  <div class="goal">
  <h4>Goal:</h4>
  <p>Description of the current step.
  <p>Red because big goals are scary.
  </div> <!-- goal -->
  <div class="steps">
  <h4>Steps:</h4>
  <pre class="term">
  % steps to take.
  </pre>
  <pre class="code">
  def code_to_write
    1 + 1
  end
  </pre>
  <p>Yellow because we've gotten it done, but we have no clue what's going on.
  </div> <!-- steps -->
  <div class="what">
  <h4>What Just Happened?</h4>
  <p>details of what the steps actually did... spell out the cause and effect.
  <p>Green because we can tie everything together now.
  </div> <!-- what -->
  </div> <!-- top-goal -->
  </div>
