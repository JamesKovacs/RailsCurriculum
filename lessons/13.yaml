  * Build the relationship between votes and topics

goal_title: Hooking up votes and topics
explanation: |
  
  * has_many and belongs_to:
  ** In rails, relationships between models are called associations
  ** Associations (usually) come in pairs
  ** A topic will have many votes so we put 'has_many :votes' in the topic model.
  *** When you ask a topic for its votes, you get an array of votes for that topic.
  ** A vote is for a particular topic, so we put 'belongs_to :topic' in the vote model.
  *** When you ask a vote for its topic, you get the topic for that vote.
