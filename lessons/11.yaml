goal_title: Commit and push to heroku
goal: |

  We just added a whole new feature. Let's push it to heroku so our
  friends can play with it.

steps: |

  In your terminal, try: (**note:** there is a period after the word add)

      $ git add .
      $ git commit -m "Added topics"
      $ git push heroku master
      $ heroku run rake db:migrate

explanation: |

  * `heroku run rake` executes a rake task on your server, in this case,
    `db:migrate`, just like you did locally.
