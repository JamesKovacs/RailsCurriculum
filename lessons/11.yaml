goal_title: Commit and push to heroku
goal: |
  
  We just added a whole new feature. Let's push it to heroku so our
  friends can play with it.

steps: |
  
  In your terminal, try: (**note:** there is a period after the word
  add in the first line)
  
      $ git add .
      $ git commit -m "Added topics"
      $ git push heroku master
      $ heroku rake db:migrate

explanation: |
  
  * We've done the first three steps before, so we won't go over that again...
  * `heroku rake` executes a rake task on your server, in this case,
    `db:migrate`, just like you did locally.
