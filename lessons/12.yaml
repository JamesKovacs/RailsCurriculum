goal_title: Creating a model for votes
goal: |
  
  ![topics_table](/img/votes_table.png)

  Every topic in suggestotron can be voted on. In order to count
  votes, we need to record votes. We'll add that table now.

steps: |
  
  In a terminal window type the following
  
      $ rails generate resource vote topic_id:integer
      $ rake db:migrate

explanation: |
  
  * Just like before, we're creating a new model named "vote"
  * The only thing really different is the integer we added called topic_id.
    * topic_id is the data we need to draw the line between votes and topics.
  * We didn't generate a full scaffold this time because we aren't
    going to do the full CRUD for votes, they're just going to be
    considered part of topics as-is.
