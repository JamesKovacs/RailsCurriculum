steps: |
  
  * Open up a terminal window to the suggestotron folder (or use one you already have setup)
  * Type the following:
  
  <pre>
  rails generate scaffold topic title:string description:text
  rake db:migrate
  rails server
  </pre>

section_content: ""
goal: |
  
  TODO: diagram of topics model
  
  
  The suggestotron has a list of topics that people can vote on. We'll
  store our topics in the database. In this step you'll do the
  following:
  
  * Create a database table for topics with a title and a description

goal_title: Creating a migration
explanation: |
  
  <code>
  rails generate scaffold topic title:string description:text
  </code>
  
  * <code>generate scaffold</code> tells rails to create everything necessary to get up and running with topics
  * <code>topic</code> tells rails the name of the new model
  * <code>title:string</code> says that topics have a title, which is a string.
  * <code>description:text</code> says that topics have a description which is a "text". We're befuddled by the difference too.
  * <code>rake db:migrate</code> tells rails to update the database to include a table for our new model
  
  # TODO: no... we need to show all the files created and say what they mean

section_title: Topics
