  <pre>
    git init .
  </pre>

goal: |
  
  
  In order to publish our application, we need to add our application
  and any changes we make over time to a "revision control system". It
  our case we're going to use git because it is (relatively) easy and it
  is what our app server, heroku, uses to deal with all changes.

goal_title: Create a new git repo
explanation: |
  
  It doesn't look like anything really happened, but 'git init'
  initialized its repository (repo) in a hidden directory called ".git".
  You can see this by typing `ls -a` (list all files).
