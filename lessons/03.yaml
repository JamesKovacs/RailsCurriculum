  By the end of this section you will:
  
  * create hashes (name/value stores)
  * loop against a hash
  * create a Class & method
  * call a method
  * Open-up a core class & define new methods


steps: |
  
  Open up a terminal window and try the following:

      $ irb

      some_hash = {1 => "Calgary", 2 => "Edmonton"}

      some_hash.keys

      some_hash.values

      some_hash.each do |k, v|
        puts "Key is #{k}, Value is #{v}"
      end

      class Workshop
        def size
          35
        end
      end

      w = Workshop.new

      w.size

      a = "My Name"

      a.class

      a.is_a?(Array)

      class String
        def speak
          puts "hello #{self}"
        end
      end

      b = "Tamer"

      b.speak

      class Duck < String
      end

      c = Duck.new
      c.speak


    

explanation: |
  * `some_hash = {1 => "Calgary", 2 => "Edmonton"}`
    * creates a hash and assigns it to variable `some_hash`
  * `some_hash.keys` and `some_hash.values`
    * calls methods for this hash that returns a list of keys and values
  * `some_hash.each ... end`
    * Looks against the hash and displays the key and value
    * the call `puts "Key is #{k}, Value is #{v}"` is equivalent to `puts "Key is " + k.to_s + ", Value is " + v.to_s
  * `class Workshop...end`
    * the Ruby way of defining a class
  * `def size...end`
    * the Ruby way of defining a method
  * `class Duck < String ... end`
    * the Ruby way of defining a class that inherits from another
