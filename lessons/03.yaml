    ## Tools to help you learn Ruby

    ### ri

    ri is a tool to look up ruby documentation:

        $ ri String.split
        = String.split

        (from ruby core)
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          str.split(pattern=$;, [limit])   => anArray

        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Divides str into substrings based on a delimiter, returning an array of
        these substrings.
        ...

    You can do a lot with it:

    * `ri Class` -- looks up the class documentation and shows all the methods available.
    * `ri Class.method` -- looks up a specific method on a class or module.
    * `ri method` -- searches all classes for matching methods

    If running ri doesn't work and you've installed ruby using rvm, try
    running this command first:

        $ rvm docs generate

    ### irb

    We've already introduced irb above, but it can't be stressed enough
    that having an interactive live session with ruby is invaluable. You
    can learn a lot from it.

    Add this to a file called ~/.irbrc:

    <pre class="code">
    :::ruby
    class Object
      def pim inherited = false
        self.class.public_instance_methods(inherited).sort -
          Object.public_instance_methods
      end
    end
    </pre>

    Now you can do stuff like:

        $ irb
        >> "blah".pim
        => ["%", "*", "+", "<<", "<=>", "[]", "[]=", "bytes", "bytesize", ...]

    All of these methods are available for any string. You can then use
    `ri` to look up the method documentation. It is a great way to find goodies!
