  Let's get started. By the end of this step, we'll have a
  brand-spankin'-new (empty) rails app.

explanation: "\n\
  * 'mkdir' stands for make directory (folder).\n\
  ** We've made a folder called railsbridge\n\
  * 'cd' stands for change directory.\n\
  ** 'cd railsbridge' makes railsbridge our current directory.\n\
  * 'rails new' creates a new rails project with the name you give.\n\
  ** In this case we told it to create a new project called suggestotron.\n\
  ** We'll go into detail on what it created shortly.\n\
  * 'ls' stands for \"list (stuff)\".\n\
  ** It shows you the contents of the current folder.\n\n\
  You can see that <code>rails new</code> created a lot directors and\n\
  files. The ones we want to focus on today are:\n\n\
  {| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" align=\"center\"\n\
  ! File/Folder\n\
  ! Purpose\n\
  |-\n\
  | app/\n\
  | Contains the controllers, models, and views for your application.  You will do most of your work here.\n\
  |-\n\
  | config/\n\
  | Configure your application\xE2\x80\x99s runtime rules, routes, database, and more.\n\
  |-\n\
  | db/\n\
  | Shows your current database schema, as well as the database migrations.\n\
  |-\n\
  | public/\n\
  | The only folder seen to the world as-is.  This is where your images, JavaScript,  stylesheets (CSS), and other static files go\n\
  |-\n\
  |}\n\n\
  There is a lot more that `rails new` created. Probably enough to fill\n\
  a book, so we're going to ignore them for now.\n"
