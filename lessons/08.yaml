  ===== ri =====
  
  ri is a tool to look up ruby documentation:
  
  <pre>
    % ri String.split
    = String.split
  
    (from ruby core)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      str.split(pattern=$;, [limit])   => anArray
  
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
    Divides str into substrings based on a delimiter, returning an array of
    these substrings.
    ...
  </pre>
  
  You can do a lot with it:
  
  * ri Class -- looks up the class documentation and shows all the methods available.
  * ri Class.method -- looks up a specific method on a class or module.
  * ri method -- searches all classes for matching methods
  
  If running ri doesn't work and you've installed ruby using rvm, try running this command first:
  <pre>
  rvm docs generate
  </pre>
  
  ===== irb =====
  
  We've already introduced irb above, but it can't be stressed enough
  that having an interactive live session with ruby is invaluable. You
  can learn a lot from it.
  
  Add this to a file called ~/.irbrc:
  
  <pre>
  def pim inherited = false
    self.class.public_instance_methods(inherited).sort -
      Object.public_instance_methods
  end
  </pre>
  
  Now you can do stuff like:
  
  <pre>
    >> "blah".pim
    => ["%", "*", "+", "<<", "<=>", "[]", "[]=", "bytes", "bytesize", "capitalize"...]
  </pre>
  
  All of these methods are available for any string. You can then use
  `ri` to look up the method documentation.
