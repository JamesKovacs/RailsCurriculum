goal_title: Running Your Application Locally
goal: |
  
  Let's fire up the application locally

steps: |
  
  In your terminal, try this:
  
      bundle
      rails server
  
  Then point your web browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
  
  See your web app actually running!

explanation: |
  
  * `bundle` installs software your application needs and prepares it to run.
  * `rails server` ran your application locally just like heroku is running it on their servers.
  * This provides a very simple means to see your changes before you commit and push them to heroku.
