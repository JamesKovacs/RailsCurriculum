goal_title: Running Your Application Locally
goal: |

  Let's fire up the application locally

steps: |

  In your terminal, try this:

      $ rails server

  Then point your web browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

  See your web app actually running!

explanation: |

  * `rails server` ran your application locally just like heroku is running it on their servers.
  * This provides a very simple means to see your changes before you commit and push them to heroku.
