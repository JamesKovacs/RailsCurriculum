goal_title: Creating a model for votes
explanation: |
  
  * Just like before, we're creating a new model named "vote"
  * The only thing really different is the integer we added called topic_id.
  ** topic_id is the data we need to draw the line between votes and topics.
  * We didn't generate a full scaffold this time because we aren't going to do the full CRUD for votes, they're just going to be considered part of topics as-is.

section_title: Voting on Topics
