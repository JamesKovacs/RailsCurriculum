goal_title: Deploy to heroku
goal: |
  
  OK. We've got an empty app and it has been added to git. What now? _**Ship it!**_

steps: |
  
  In your terminal, try:
  
      heroku create
      git push heroku master
      heroku open

explanation: |
  
  * `heroku create` registers a new application on heroku's system.
  * `git push` takes all changes you've committed locally and pushes them to heroku.
  * `heroku open` opens the new application in your browser.
  
  While I realize that at this point this isn't all that exciting, the
  point is that it doesn't get more difficult than this as we add more
  functionality to the application. Your typical process will look like:
  
  ![workflow](/img/workflow.png)
  
  1. Add/change some functionality.
  2. `git commit -m "msg" files`
  3. `git push heroku master`
  4. (wash, rinse, repeat)
  
  and boom! Your changes are live!
